#  XmasLootBox

Merry Christmas!
Welcome to the 2022 Discord Advent Calendar!

Every day in the month of December, users will be able to interact with the Discord bot to claim a special gift: *4 completely unique NFTs and 0.01 ETH sent to your very own Ethereum (testnet) wallet!*

Every gift's artwork will be procedurally generated and created by an AI program (Dalle-2) that translates natural language text into images.
Each NFT will be randomly generated with different attributes and rarity levels.
Attributes include a variety of subjects, hats, eyes, scarfs, and backgrounds.
With over 1,249,248 possibilities, there is sure to be something for everyone!
...and if not, you can send your NFTs as gifts to other users if you are feeling the Christmas spirit!

There are 7 Rarity Levels (listed in order of increasing rarity):

| Rarity Level      |
| -----------       |
| Common            |
| Uncommon          |
| Rare              |
| Legendary         |
| Mythical          |
| N-F-Tacular       |
| Christmas Miracle |

Tune-in every day to collect your advent calendar gift!
Once I create an account for you, you will be able to see your collection on [Opensea](https://testnets.opensea.io/)!
