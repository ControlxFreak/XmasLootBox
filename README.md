# Discord Christmas NFT Loot Box Advent Calendar

Merry Christmas!
Welcome to the 2022 Discord Christmas NFT Loot Box Advent Calendar!

Every day in the month of December, users will be able to interact with the Discord bot to claim a special gift, a completely unique (and real) NFT that will be minted to the Ethereum Goerli testnet and be placed in your very own Ethereum wallet!
Every gift's artwork will be procedurally generated and created by an AI program ([Dalle-2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/)) that translates natural language text into images.
Each NFT will be randomly generated with different atributes and rarity levels.
Attributes include a variety of subjects, hats, eyes, beards, scarfs, and backgrounds!
With over 22,656,816 possiblities, there is sure to be something for everyone!

... Also, as a special Christmas gift, Santa will be loading up your Ethereum wallets with $1 Billion dollars in Ethereum (~758,000 ETH), so feel free to set prices and trade NFTs amongst yourselves!

There are 7 Rarity Levels (listed in order of increasing rarity):

| Rarity Level      |
| -----------       |
| Common            |
| Uncommon          |
| Rare              |
| Legendary         |
| Mythical          |
| N-F-Tacular       |
| Christmas Miracle |

Tune-in every day to collect your Advent Calendar gift!
Once I generate your wallet addresses, you can see your NFT collection on [Opensea](https://testnets.opensea.io/)!
